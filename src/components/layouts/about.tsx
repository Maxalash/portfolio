      <p>
        Back in 2021, I decided to delve into the world of web development
        during my internship at LLC Inomad in Almaty. This initial experience
        led me down the path of coding and software engineering. Fast-forward to
        today, and I&apos;ve had the opportunity to develop and enhance web
        components for a blockchain company, integrate complex systems, and lead
        a team of talented developers at LLC Prometeo Chain System.
        <br />
        <br />
        My current focus is on creating seamless and engaging user interfaces
        while integrating advanced backend functionalities. I thrive at the
        intersection of design and engineering, ensuring that the software not
        only looks great but also performs exceptionally well. In my free time,
        I&apos;ve developed a staking dApp for NFT staking and contributed to
        social networking projects like Nigma Galaxy.
        <br />
        <br />
        When I&apos;m not coding, you can find me exploring new technologies,
        reading up on the latest trends in blockchain, or hiking in the
        beautiful landscapes of Kazakhstan.
